### 👋 Hi there, I am Miro!
#### Recently I've left my non-Technical job to start learning/coding full time without distractions. 
#### I am looking for an entry level job to utilize my skills and I am open for new opportunities!

<br>

* 🔭 I’m currently working on personal projects - mostly [Footwear](https://github.com/milyo001/Footwear).
* 🌱 I’m currently learning C# Design Patterns.
* 🤔 I’m looking for help with: nothing at the moment, trying to learn stuff by myself. Open for tips and tricks tho! 
* 💬 Ask me about: anything.
* 📫 How to reach me: [💼 LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miroslav-ilyovski-2ab573150) or 📫 [email](mailto:ilyovskim@gmail.com)
* ❤️ I love working out, hiking, video games and obviously coding :grin:.
